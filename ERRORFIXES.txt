ERROR 1 - internal server error 500
------------------------------------
Cause by directory and file permission, fix by using a recursive chmod tricks. Folder permission should be 755 and file permission should be 644. The following command that can be executed in linux shell will fix the problem.

Recursively chmod only directories
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

Recursively chmod only files
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
